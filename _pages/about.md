Today marks the start of a new project. A project that defines what I believe in life and to which things I aspire to.

My bio is simple: a software developer with an ambition. Sharing my life and journey with the scope to empower other people. Mistakes are what we learn from and they shape us into the people we are today.

Enjoy the journey !
