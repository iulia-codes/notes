Websummit is the biggest tech conference in the world. This year I have attended websummit for the first time. With this post, I will share with the world tips & tricks, what I have learned and how you can get the modt of websummit.

First, what you need to know is that websummit  is more than a conference. It is a gathering where tech leaders, political & governmental people come together. Startups, angels and investors are also going to be on site.

## Five tips for websummit

1. Prepare early 

You can pre-register for the yearly event as quick as from the last day of the current websummit.

Since the event is held yearly in late autumn, perhaps planning in January- February is a good idea.

I got my ticket in February 2018 for the yearâ€˜s summit.

2. Research early

With around 60.000 attendees, the event enables you to network with like-minded people. 

Depending on the reason you are visiting, make a list of the companies you are interested in.

3. Participate at Partner workshops

You will find that most of the presentations are very high level. But going to the partner workshops is a very good idea to dwelve deeper into a specific topic ( and by this, I mean hands on code) aws from amazon had a pretty strong presence this year.

4. Participate at sunset summit / night summit

The sunset summit is a post-presentation event. It has a colorful vibe as it will give you a quick intro to Portugal. There you will be able to experience the taste, sound, culture of Portugal. You will get some free snacks like cheese or donuts, but prepare to invest from your own pocket.

Night summit is a similar ideea, with location within Lisbon.

5. Bring your own food and a bottle 

I cannot stress this enough. There is street food at the event, but the long queues will wear you off. Also the prices are double if not triple with what you would pay in Lisbon.

This was quite disappointing to be honest.

Also, bring your own water bottle. Water is free and you will get a chance to refill the bottle to keep you hydrated and happy. Expect some deltaQ coffee as well, but the quality of the coffee could be improved in my ( and others ) opinion.

6. Wear your most comfortable shoes

This is no joke. You will have to sprint a lot through the pavilions. Make sure you wear the most comfy shoes you have, preferrably with a bigger sole. Only in the first day, I walked 14 km :)

7. Visit the booths

There are rarely any freebies at websummit. Knowledge is , however, for free. Make contact with the companies there if you are interested in a specific topic. They will want to scan your badge, and you will get a small gift for that. Sometimes there will be small games that you van play. Table tennis ( kicker) was pretty popular this year.

Hope you have learned some new things. Have you participated at websummit before? Let me know your questions and I will answer them below.
