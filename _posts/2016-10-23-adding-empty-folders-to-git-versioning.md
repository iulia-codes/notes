Today I had just started to re-organize my Thinkful FEWD course. So I have created folders with each of the units/lessons of the FrontEnd Development v6.

To my surprise, when I wanted to add these folders to git, git would simply not recognize any change.

The solution? Add an empty README.md file to each of the folders...and voila! Now you can upload your changes.
