Don't get me wrong, I think Facebook is great. It helps connect people, it is great with events and lately the Live stream is also a great addition.

However, I just don't like the fact that they push things onto their users. It's like mom trying to make us eat our vegetables. No, thank you!

So what's the deal? I think I am one of the few that do not have the Facebook messenger application. I use Android and browse Facebook in Chrome. So far so good, right? 
The thing is that I also check/reply to my messages in the browser. Which wasn't a problem until 1st of June 2016.

Facebook decided that I MUST use their Facebook messenger app. And so they are automatically opening the Google play store link to download
Facebook messenger. Abusive, to somewhat standard.

To be continued....
