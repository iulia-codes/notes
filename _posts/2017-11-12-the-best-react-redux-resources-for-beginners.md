This page summarizes my research made to do a fast ramp-up in the topics of React/Redux. These both frameworks are like bread and butter for eachother and go well hand in hand. You can start by learning either of them - but it is always assumed that you have a Javascript background.

## React resources
⋅⋅* [Thinkful React](https://courses.thinkful.com/react-001v3)
I always liked the way the Thinkful courses are written. Light reading and easy to understand formulations.

⋅⋅*  [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/)
Wes Bros offers a React for Beginners course that will guide you through the basics of React, while building an app.

##  Redux resources

⋅⋅* [Redux Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
There is no more obvious first place to go for Redux resources, than the Egghead series made by the creator. Completing this series will give you a good start, but also raise questions that you will be able to answer later, in practice.


##  React + Redux
⋅⋅* [Using React with Redux by Microsoft](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/using-react-with-redux-17730)

The Microsoft Virtual Academy always offers extremly easy to follow resources. I really like this resource that combines the understanding of both React and Redux.
