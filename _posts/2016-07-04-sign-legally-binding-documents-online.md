Sometimes, you might need to sign legally binding documents online. How to achieve this without having to sign to a paid service? Luckily the web provides us with a plethora of options - but my favourite is <a href="https://www.hellosign.com/">hellosign</a>

I have signed up there in a few minutes - using my existing Google account. Then I took advantage of the available features:

* collaborative document signing (multiple people to sign a document)
* single document signing (I sign the document)
* document download, share and send by email

The free option of the website allows you to sign 3 documents per month. If you would like to upgrade to other features of the website, then the paid option is available. Have you tried this option? Has it worked for you?
