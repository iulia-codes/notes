Setting up Ruby for the first time, can be a challenging task. Especially if you are trying to do that on Windows, and with an existing project which you do not know. And a programming language that you do not know. But with time and patience, everything can be done.

Github pages are really powerful at offering free hosting, given that you use Jekyll, which is a static website generator.

I come from the Wordpress world, which I do honestly love with all my heart. However, setting up Wordpress for a small website, was not something I had in mind. And the functionalities that I needed are available for free.

Here I am now, one day after, with the instructions on how to setup your own Jekyll blog on Windows. For Linux and MAC, there are other instructions and possibly, a plethora of information on the web.

Given the flavours of developer tools out there, this tutorial is intended for my current setup. Here is my environemnt setup:

* Windows 8.1 x64
* Sublime Text Build 3114
