<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B821" target="_blank">Build 2016</a> was the first ever event to introduce chat bots, courtesy of Microsoft. If you're wondering what a chat bot is - it is a smart bot that listens to you and performs some tasks you tell it to. Say, you want to have a bot in your chat list that will automatically send you warnings for the area you live in. Or you simply what to order a salad from your favourite restaurant. A chat bot can do this, or more.

The first chat bot introduced was the Skype bot. What I like about it, is that it is crossplatform. Really, you can integrate it whereever, say Slack for example. 

Now, if this interests you, I suggest that you start with a bunch of theoretical notions. You need to understand what a chat bot is and what it can do. Here is a list of steps that I have put together, to get you started with writing your own bot with Skype.

* How to build a bot for Skype

There could be no better description that the one offered by Microsoft, so I am quoting it in what follows... In the Skype developer session you will hear about some new and innovative ways we are going to enhance messaging experiences today, and into the future. Microsoft believes that adding intelligence into every day conversations will empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This is the way you’ve always wanted to communicate, but never realized it could be so easy. I’m going to show you our vision for intelligence integrated into one of the most popular ways people connect today – Skype.

* Build a conversational bot from 0 to 60

The Microsoft Bot Framework provides everything you need to build and connect your bots to your users wherever they converse – from SMS to Office365 mail to Slack and more… It’s your bot, wherever your users are talking. Learn how to use the Bot Framework to build a bot with your own existing code, use the Bot Builder to generate conversational dialogs from scratch, and more to give your bot skills with natural language processing and deep learning technology. Walk away with tools to build a great bot that can connect with users, wherever they are.

* Acquaint yourself with the bot framework

<a href="https://dev.botframework.com/" target="_blank">The bot framework </a>

Get acquainted with the open source builder SDK. This SDK can be used to build Node.JS based apps, but also using the .NET framework.

* Observe some cool API's you can use

<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/apis">Microsoft cognitive services</a> offers some nice options for computer vision, speech,language, text and knowledge. After watchin the two videos above, you'll see how you can use LUIS to make your bot understand your natural language commands.

* Be social, join the community

Although the community is closed, you can sign up with your skype account and pose your questions there. What is nice is that you will have answers from real people working on the real project of the SDK for Skype. So take a plunge - <a href="https://community.skype.com/t5/Skype-Bot-Developers/gp-p/Bot_devs" target="_blank">dive into it</a>.
