If you are visiting Germany for the first time, and also planning to stay, then you should know a few things before coming here. Plan ahead, plan thoroughly. The information listed below is my experience with getting started as a student in Germany. You should know that each Land regulates the school rules, therefore the rules might differ from land to land.

### Checklist before you come to Germany

There are a few things ( papers ) which you will need to have upon coming to Germany. See if you have all of them, if not, obtain them IN TIME, don't leave it until the last minutes.

1. Visa (non EU Member)
2. <a href ="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=509&langId=en" target="_blank"> European Health Insurance ( EU Member )</a>
3. Valid Passport ( don't rely on your local identification card, they are usually written in your home language and difficult for authorities to understand)
4. Acceptance letter ( the letter that you received when you got admitted to the University )
5. Cash money ( have around 1200 euro with you as you will need to pay in advance for the rent )
6. School papers ( officially translated )
7. Be informed on the opening times of the institutions you need to visit
	* Verify the schedule for the Sekretariat of your University ( there you will need to register)
	* Verify the schedule for the Studentenwerk of your University ( there you will need to sign your room renting contract)
	* Verify the schedule for the Health Insurance company ( there you will need to get a health insurance )

8. Find a place to stay in your first night of coming to Germany

	It is very improbable that you will manage to visit all the institutions in the same day. Find a room to spend the night, book a hotel ahead.

9. Passport pictures

	Have 2-3 passport pictures with you, which you will need later.

The guide below applies to Nordrhein Westfalen land for the University of Bonn and requires all information to get you started in Germany. Every paper you need to sign is detailed below, every step you need to take you can find here.

Everyone must know that Germany is a country governed by laws, rules and procedures. Below is listed the information to get you started in Germany. Check below which applies to you.

### Where do you come from?

1. EU member

	As an EU member, things are straightforward. You will need only your health insurance <a href ="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=509&langId=en" target="_blank"> European Health Insurance ( EU Member )</a> and some money to get your started.

2. Non EU member

	As a non EU member, you will need to have a closed bank account of around 8000 euro. You also need to apply early for your visa.

Both for EU and non EU members, the following steps are the same. Read them carefully.

### Where will you live?

1. Sign the renting contract

	The renting contract is always signed at the main Studentenwerk organisation of your local university. <a href="http://www.studentenwerk-bonn.de/wohnen/" target="_blank" >Here</a> is the link for Studentenwerk Bonn.

	It is very important that you visit the offices exactly when the opening hours are. When you visit the office they will require from you:

	* Passport
	* Pay the Kaution ( a fund that you will get back after you move out of the room ) and the rent for the first month
	* A bank account from where they can withdraw the monthly rent ( simply fill in the form with the bank account info after you get your bank account)

2. Move into your room

	Depending on where you live, there are different opening times for the Hausmeister ( the person responsible with the building ). 

	It is very important that you visit the offices exactly when the opening hours are. When you visit the office they will require from you:

* Passport
* The signed renting contract
* Your contact details and a passport picture

	After that you will receive a key for your room, after you are explained the rules on how to use the room. 

### Where will you be insured for health insurance?

Health insurance is mandatory in Germany. This is required in order to provide you with the best services when you have a health problem.

Again, here are two cases:

1. EU member

	As an EU member you may use the European Health Insurance for signing up. After that, you may choose to take upon a German Health Insurance offered for students.

2. Non EU member

	As a non EU member, you will need to have a health insurance in order to register at the University. Do not go without a health insurance for the registration at the University.

	<a href="https://rh.aok.de/" target="_blank"> AOK is known to be very international and have plans for students. </a>

### Where will you study?

The University at which you study will have a Sekretariat ( office ) with specific opening hours. Inform yourself on the opening hours, and visit the office then.

It is very important that you visit the offices exactly when the opening hours are. When you visit the office they will require from you:

* Passport
* The health insurance
* The admission letter

After you sign the registration to the University, you will receive a two weeks temporary paper. This paper states that you are a student of the University and you may travel freely in the whole land with the public transport.

### Where do you register with the city?

When you move to Germany, you must register with the city. This means, you must inform the city that you have just moved in. This is called Anmeldung. Not doing so, is illegal.

To register with the city, you must make an appointment first. Visit the Stadthaus website of your local city, and make an appointment online. For example, for Bonn, one may do so at the following <a href = "https://netappoint.de/ot/stadtbonn/?company=stadtbonn" target="_blank"> link </a>.

It is very important that you visit the offices exactly when the opening hours are. When you visit the office they will require from you:

* Passport
* The renting contract
* You will fill a paper similar to this <a href="https://www3.bonn.de/forms/findform?shortname=Anmeldung&formtecid=2&areashortname=Bonn" target = "_blank"> one </a>

After that, you will receive an A4 paper stating that you have registered with the city and free tickets to visit museums and to participate to language courses. <b>Keep this paper in a safe place! This paper is very important.</b>

### Which bank account will you have?

A bank account is needed so that you pay the monthly rent from it. 

Go to a bank of your choice, such as Deutsche Bank, and apply for  a Jungeskonto. <b>Have with you the paper that you received when you registered with the city.</b>


These are all the steps required to register in Germany. There are more things to be discussed, such as food, waste separation, TV/Radio Tax, exams regulations.
