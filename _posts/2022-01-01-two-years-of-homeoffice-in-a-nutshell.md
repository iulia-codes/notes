# Two Years in Homeoffice in a Nutshell

## Introduction

It is 659 days from the start date to the end date, but not including the end date.

Or 1 year, 9 months, 19 days excluding the end date.

Or 21 months, 19 days excluding the end date.

What do these numbers mean ? I will share the story below and as well what home office setup I have *that works*.
## A warm spring

2020 started like any other year. The weather was getting warmer, the flowers were blooming and we just celebrated international woman's day on the 8th of March. The work routine was following its normal course - drive to work, code, lunch, code and then go at the gym or home.

## Last day at the gym

Religously going to the gym as my habit dictates it, after work, at one of the gyms that our company provides for the employees. A benefit which I am very grateful for!

In that specific day I was doing my running routine as usual. I started running in 2014 using the couch25k program (highly recommend!). The gym was empties than usual, but I did not think much of it, as it was usually empty at that time. However, the next day, everything changed.


## Homeoffice where possible

Homeoffice was something I have experience with before. In that day of 13th of March 2020, the first day of homeoffice officially started. The world was just starting to experience the rage of the coronavirus, so to protect us, our company recommended us to work from home.

My initial setup looked as below:
