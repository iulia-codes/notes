## Introduction

It is 659 days from the start date to the end date, but not including the end date.

Or 1 year, 9 months, 19 days excluding the end date.

Or 21 months, 19 days excluding the end date.

What do these numbers mean ? I will share the story below and as well what home office setup I have *that works*.
## A warm spring

2020 started like any other year. The weather was getting warmer, the flowers were blooming and we just celebrated international woman's day on the 8th of March. The work routine was following its normal course - drive to work, code, lunch, code and then go at the gym or home.

## Last day at the gym

Religously going to the gym as my habit dictates it, after work, at one of the gyms that our company provides for the employees. A benefit which I am very grateful for!

In that specific day I was doing my running routine as usual. I started running in 2014 using the couch25k program (highly recommend!). The gym was empties than usual, but I did not think much of it, as it was usually empty at that time. However, the next day, everything changed.


## Homeoffice where possible

Homeoffice was something I have experience with before. In that day of 13th of March 2020, the first day of homeoffice officially started. The world was just starting to experience the rage of the coronavirus, so to protect us, our company recommended us to work from home.

My initial setup looked as below:

{% endcapture %}


## The homeoffice journey 

Our first day of homeoffice was the spring of 2020. Since then, my homeoffice setup needed to be adjusted. Therefore I adjusted the setup privately with:
- one monitor
- one monitor holder, that you can adjust in height
- one router

And the technical details of each:
- SAMSUNG LU28R554UQUEN 28 Zoll UHD 4K Monitor (4 ms Reaktionszeit, 60 Hz)
- Invision 22-35 Zoll Monitor Halterung Höhenverstellbar, Neigung und Drehbar VESA 75/100 Gewicht 3-12 kg Gasunterstützter MX450
- Fritzbox router

## Looking into the future

Right now there are is the so called "Homeofficepflicht". This means, wherever possible, you should work from home. 

If you want to work from the office, there is a general 3G (genesen, geteset, geimpft) rule for the whole Germany. 

What are your experiences with transitioning from in-office work to home-office work? Share your comments below! :)
